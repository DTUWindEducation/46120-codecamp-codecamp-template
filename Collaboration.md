either divide the homework, or agree on a day to complete the homework together. 

   * Branches off main? Who reviews pull requests?
   - When doing homework individually, we work on our own branches. When done, the person creates a pull-

   The person who takes responsibility can also accept it.

   - After lectures, the team works physically untill the end of the lecture. 
   - Depending on the extend of the homework / task in question, it shall be decided among 
   the group members if the work requires physical presence or if a virtual meeting can do the task.

   - We communicate on Microsoft Teams, using the chat there.
